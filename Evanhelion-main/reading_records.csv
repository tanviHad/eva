And the nation crossed the danger threshold of electing the most unstable, unready and extreme president in U.S. history. But not to worry, says Paul Manafort. In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can ""fill the chair."" And that ban on Muslims? ""He's already started moderating on that,"" Manafort said. ""He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more."" The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death. ""It is beyond contempt,"" she wrote, ""that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy."" But that's where Trump lives.

Unlike Bush, he has no messianic zealots among his advisers. He gives the kind of well-considered responses that suggest a president who carefully engages with truly difficult policy conundrums.  Yet at the end of the day, he often comes across as vacillating and indecisive -- an impression that can be fatal in his dealings with allies, adversaries, and of course electorates.","Robert Kuttner, ContributorCo-founder and co-editor, 'The American Prospect'",11-08-2014,0,1.197242067064501,32557,9

For instance: In our culture of overwork, burnout, and exhaustion, how do we tap into our creativity, our wisdom, our capacity for wonder, our well-being and our ability to connect with what we really value? Solvitur ambulando. By walking we move through the world not just physically, but also spiritually. Often by ""taking a walk"" we mean that we're not walking to get anywhere in particular.

On Monday, 47 Republican senators released an open letter to Iran. The misguided missive purported to help Iran ""fully understand our constitutional system,"" but was widely derided as a meddling and dangerous precedent. Maybe the senators' next letter will reveal how they plan to pay for another Middle East war, one that could be averted by a successful deal with the Iranians. That same day Apple rolled out the Apple Watch. Fans are already lining up, but do we really need to be even more distracted by endless notifications? Given how Steve Jobs said his best ideas came when he calmed his mind, it's an interesting question whether he'd have created Apple if he'd been endlessly distracted by having an Apple Watch on his wrist.

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.

This weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a ""no"" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.

Nobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand. As they point out by examining the Argentine default in 2001, there is ""life after debt and default."" Manolis Glezos, the elderly firebrand of Syriza, writes from Athens that, in a democracy, ""the people are the measure"" of their fate.

Within days, the F.B.I. announced that it was treating the carnage as a terrorist attack. While we may not be able to guarantee that such appalling events never happen, we can control our reaction to them. As investigators continue to look into the couple's motives, it's important that we not surrender our core values of tolerance and openness. The actions of a few have nothing to do with the nearly 3 million Muslims living peacefully in the U.S. Already, a mosque in Virginia has received death threats, and an Islamic center in Florida was vandalized. To give in to those impulses is to give the enemies of tolerance what they want. The actions of extremists and terrorists can't defeat us, but we can defeat ourselves.","Arianna Huffington, Contributor",06-12-2015,21,1.4142135623730951,32842,52

This phrase refers to the 4th century Greek philosopher Diogenes's response to the question of whether motion is real -- he got up and walked. ""It is solved by walking."" As it turns out, there are many other problems to which walking is the solution. For instance: In our culture of overwork, burnout, and exhaustion, how do we tap into our creativity, our wisdom, our capacity for wonder, our well-being and our ability to connect with what we really value? Solvitur ambulando. By walking we move through the world not just physically, but also spiritually. Often by ""taking a walk"" we mean that we're not walking to get anywhere in particular. But even when we are walking toward a destination, when we're walking to connect two places, the in-between -- the space, the interval -- can be more important.","Arianna Huffington, Contributor

On Thursday, Trump met with Paul Ryan, with the two calling the talk a ""positive step toward unification,"" and Ryan adding that Trump is a ""very warm and genuine person."" If Ryan ends up endorsing Trump, he must be held accountable for what he's endorsing. As Senator Harry Reid said of his GOP counterpart, ""Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs."" Rough stuff but he has a point: You either believe we should deport 12 million people or you don't. You either believe there should be a religious test to enter the U.S. or you don't. But the GOP isn't alone in its attempts to white-wash Trump. The New York Times referred to Trump's racism as ""a reductive approach to ethnicity."" This is how someone like Trump can actually get to the White House in 2016: because of the reluctance -- by political leaders and the media -- to call out racism when they see it.","Arianna Huffington, Contributor",15-05-2016,19,1.2296013635389607,1107,98
